				So, you want to learn how to play Astatos? If so, you've come to the right place!
				<br> In this tutorial, I, Max, will guide you through the basics of this game's PvP mode: Takeover!
				<br> As soon as you start an online game, (Through the Trial -> Takeover menu) you'll have to pick Heroes to ban (1 per player) and pick Heroes to use. (5 per player) Only then can the game really start.

				<br> Your influence has two indicators: The bar at the top, and the card displayed in the lower left of the screen, after you reach 5 influence points for your side, you win!
				<br> I've been going on about influence, but how do you even get it? As I (somewhat) said before, you use different heroes' abilities, of course! Most of them are straightfowards, like drawing a card or removing one energy from your opponent! However! There are a few cards with some special features, leading us to...
